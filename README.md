# Group Project ERHS 535 : Invasive Species in the Top 15 National Parks

This group project involved creating an interactive and visually engaging flexdashboard using RMarkdown. The project was a collaborative effort, with team members dividing responsibilities for designing the framework and developing the visualizations.The work here illustrates the prevalence of the various invasive species found in the top 15 most visited National parks in the USA.

The data for this analysis was sourced from the [Tidy Tuesday GitHub repository](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2024/2024-10-08). The data was collected by the [National Park Services ](https://irma.nps.gov/NPSpecies/Search/SpeciesList). The information in NPSpecies is available to the public for more detailed information on the dataset, here is the [Glossary](https://irma.nps.gov/content/npspecies/Help/docs/NPSpecies_User_Guide.pdf) for column names, field options, and tag meanings. 

The parks in this analysis include:
1. Acadia National Park 
2. Bryce Canyon National Park
3. Cuyahoga Valley National Park
4. Glacier National Park 
5. Grand Canyon National Park 
6. Grand Teton National Park
7. Great Smoky Mountains National Park
8. Hot Springs National Park
9. Indiana Dunes National Park
10. Joshua Tree National Park
11. Olympic National Park
12. Rocky Mountain National Park 
13. Yellowstone National Park
14. Yosemite National Park 
15. Zion National Park

The flexboard illustrates three plots that look at various aspects of the National park species data.The plots include a heat map depicting invasive species and their distribution across parks,and a plot showing the correlation of non-native species, and visitor impact across National parks emphasizing the ecological and anthropogenic factors affecting national parks,
